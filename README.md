# to-do-app
A BASIC CRUD APPLICATION TO PRACTICE vue.js and spring boot framework.
I wanted to learn the basic v-bind, v-model and app structure of vue.js so I created the front-end in it. Fetch API was used to send POST requests to the backend.
I used Spring boot framework in the backend for easy database interactions and for creating a RestFUL API. 

The UI and front-end part looks bad, so the future plan is to improve it.
